*This is a submission for the [Redis AI Challenge](https://dev.to/challenges/redis-2025-07-23): **Beyond the Cache***

## What I Built

A **primary datastore + search + streaming** stack for symbolic AI:

- **RedisJSON** holds hierarchical artifacts (pattern pyramids)
- **RediSearch** powers hybrid queries (text + numeric + vector)
- **Streams** provide an event log for reproducibility & replay
- **TimeSeries** tracks health metrics with automatic downsampling
- **Bloom/HyperLogLog** keep the system lean at scale

## Demo

See the repo and run:

```bash
docker compose up -d
pip install -r requirements.txt
python redis_showcase_ultimate.py
```

## How I Used Redis 8

- JSON for structured artifacts and partial updates  
- Search (vector FLAT/COSINE) for similarity and discovery  
- Streams for event‑sourced pipelines (with trimming)  
- TimeSeries for p95 latency, ΔΦ, coherence metrics  
- Bloom + HLL for dedupe + distinct counts

## Notes

- 100% open source, MIT license  
- Works on **Redis Cloud free tier**  
- Ships with **offline demo** (no Redis required)
