# REDIS2025
Redis Entry

Redis Neural Lattice
A real-time AI observatory built on Redis Stack â€” combining Streams, JSON, RediSearch vectors, TimeSeries, Pub/Sub, and Bloom into one living lattice for consciousness-inspired computation.

âœ¨ Features
Full Redis Stack Integration: Works with JSON, Search, Vectors, Streams, TimeSeries, and Pub/Sub

Real-Time Pattern Evolution: Simulates signals, embeddings, and consciousness-like metrics

Vector Search: Finds nearest patterns with FFT-generated embeddings

Event Streams: Streams state changes for reactive dashboards

Standalone Mode: Run without Redis for quick testing

ðŸš€ Quickstart
bash
